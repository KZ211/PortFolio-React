        <p>I'm in the admission course at the University of 3 de Febrero (UNTREF) aimed at the undergraduate degree in "Computer Engineering". I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in a small town in the northern area called "Presidente Derqui". I began to delve into programming at the age of 16, but then stopped for a while as I didn't have a clear path to follow, and ended up feeling frustrated. In 2022, I decided to pick it up again and push forward with my career as a developer. I credit my learning to my partner Steven Aragon (a senior programmer and co-founder of Claps). Thanks to him, I now have a solid foundation in many computational areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, MySQL, and finally, the React Framework.</p>
